// Incentive Calculation Logic

// Calculate incentive using the formula:

// incentive = (totalTarget - totalBusinessClosed) / 100


// If the calculated value is positive, then incentive is totalBusinessClosed/100 use it as-is.

// If the calculated value is negative, convert it to its absolute value which is divided by 100.

// If the calculated value is 0, total_payable should be calculated salary of attendance details


// Button Behavior
// Pay as Salary should be visibe only if incentive is greater than 0

// On click:

// Open a confirmation modal.

// Set current_remaining_target to 0.

// Add the previous "incentive" to Salary Payable.

// Pay as Incentive
// Pay as Incentive should be visibe only if incentive is greater than 0

// On click:

// Open a confirmation modal.

// Set current_remaining_target to 0.
